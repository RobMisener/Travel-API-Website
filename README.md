## Overview: 
Routa is an ASP.NET MVC that allows users to search for travel hotspots in the city of their choice and add each location of their choice to a daily travel itinerary. It uses C#, JavaScript, ASP.NET MVC, RIOT.js, and GoogleMaps/GooglePlaces API.

## API / Search:
Routa uses the GoogleMaps/GooglePlaces API to instantly return hotpsots and locations to the user depending on what the user requests. 

## Advanced Search Features:
The user may also choose to use advanced search features to narrow down locations by bars, museums, and hotspots of interest. The user may add these locations to their itinerary and save it after they register. 

## Registration
A registered user can access their itinerary by date at any time from the SQL databases when they are logged in to Routa.
